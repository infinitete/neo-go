# Conventions

When submitting a new convention, please open an issue for discussion, if possible please highlight parts in the code where this convention could help the code readiblity or simplicity.


## Avoid Named return paramters


func example(test int) (num int) {
    a = test + 1
    num = a * test
    return
}

In the above function we have used a named return paramter, which allows you to include a simple return statement without the variables you are returning. This practice can cause confusion when functions become large or the logic becomes complex, so these should be avoided.
